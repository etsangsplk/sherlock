### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified. The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used. Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
# reporting-disabled = false

# Bind address to use for the RPC service for backup and restore.
# bind-address = "127.0.0.1:8088" ###
### [meta]
###
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.

[meta]
  # Where the metadata/raft database is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

  # Automatically create a default retention policy when creating a database.
  # retention-autocreate = true

  # If log messages are printed for the meta service
  # logging-enabled = true

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.

[data]
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores TSM files.
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"
  # The directory where the TSM storage engine stores WAL files.
  wal-dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/wal"
  # The type of shard index to use for new shards.  The default is an in-memory index that is
  # recreated at startup.  A value of "tsi1" will use a disk based index that supports higher
  # cardinality datasets.
