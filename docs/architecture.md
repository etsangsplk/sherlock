`sherlock` is or will be a visualization tool a UI for traces. It contains two
parts a backend and the fronted, but it will be shipped as a single binary.

## backend
It is a Go application; it exposes an HTTP API that the frontend will use to
lookup traces and other information.

## frontend
It is a javascript single page application.

## e2e architecture
Pretty nice graph!

We are trying to keep things boring here!
